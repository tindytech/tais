    "Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone.  The teachable Machine is flexible – use files or capture examples live. It’s respectful of the way you work. You can choose to use it entirely on-device, without any webcam or microphone data leaving your computer. To use the teachable machine, you'll follow the procedure of **gather**, **train**, and **export** (optional).\n",

    "#### [Gather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBbSTvtpy4)\n",
    "Gather and group your examples into classes, or categories, that you want the computer to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO67EQ0ZWgA)\n",
    "Train your model, then instantly test it out to see whether it can correctly classify new examples.\n",

    "#### [Export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zeeRLBgd0)\n",

    "**Step 3.** Select a project type: [Image Project](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) (Standard Model), [Audio Project](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/audio), or [Pose Project](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/pose).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4.** Train your first machine learning model by following the on-screen instructions.\n",

    "If the on-screen instructions aren't clear enough, click on [Gather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBbSTvtpy4), [Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO67EQ0ZWgA), or [Export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zeeRLBgd0) to watch videos of each step in the process."

    "Neural networks are good at pattern recognition, but they can be easily fooled. For example, pixels maliciously added to medical scans could fool a deep neural network (DNN) into wrongly detecting cancer. With many deep learning systems such as self-driving cars, crime detection systems, and medical diagnosis tools now moving from the lab into the real world, it has become increasingly important to:\n",

    "Having a hard time thinking of ways to break the machine?  Remember, you're not actually breaking the machine, just exposing where it is already broken.  Testers generally apply a number of techniques and heuristics to look for bugs in traditional software.  Browse the _Exploratory Testing_ section of the training cheatsheet.  Perhaps some of the listed heuristics can help you with ideas for generating tests for the teachable machine.  Happy Testing!\n",
